# Sudoku Game

This project is a Sudoku game created using **C++** and the **raylib** graphics library. The goal of the project was to learn about game graphics, algorithm design, and working with C++ data structures to create a fully functional game. 
The game runs on a game loop and includes custom algorithms for random Sudoku generation, color coding for better UI, and interactive gameplay.

## Features

- **Sudoku Game Logic**: The game logic was designed by me and includes custom algorithms for:
  - Sudoku puzzle generation.
  - User interaction (hovering over squares and clicking numbers).
  - Validating the puzzle.
  
- **Graphics**: Developed using **raylib**, which handles the graphics for displaying the Sudoku grid and interactive features. The game includes:
  - Color coding for correct/incorrect gueses.
  - Smooth and dynamic UI updates.
  
- **Random Sudoku Generation**: The game has an algorithm that generates a random Sudoku puzzle with an easy or hard difficulty.

## Installation

To play the game, you'll need to set it up in **Visual Studio** since **raylib** is required for the project. The raylib files are included in the initial commit.
I do not know how to properly configure a make with raylib as its essential to the project and this was the only way I could get it to properly work.

### Controls:
- **Hover** over a square and click a number to fill it.
- The game runs on a continuous game loop which checks for updates, so you can interact with the puzzle while the game runs.
- Their are buttons on the right side which you can use to interact with the game.
## Project Overview

This project was my first personal game development project and gave me a glimpse into working with graphics, creating my own algorithms, and understanding C++ data structures. It was a rewarding experience, and I'm happy with how it turned out.

### Key Takeaways:
- Understanding the integration of graphics libraries like **raylib** with C++.
- Designing and implementing algorithms for game mechanics (Sudoku generation and validation).
- Handling user input and rendering updates in a game loop.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed as part of my exploration into graphics programming and algorithm design. I'm proud of the results, and it helped me gain a better understanding of creating interactive games.
